Attemps=log((-ProbabilityAfterAttempts+1))/log((1-ProbabilityOfSuccess))
//Method Generates the number of attemps needed in order to get a certain probability of success after those attempts have been made.  
//Enter the probability of success after the attempts have been made as "ProbabilityAfterAttempts"
//ENter the probability of success after 1 attempt as "ProbabilityOfSuccess"
//The attempts variable gets the number of attempts needed to achive the ProbabilityAfterAttempts variable
//Variable ProbabilityAfterAttempts must be >0 and <1
